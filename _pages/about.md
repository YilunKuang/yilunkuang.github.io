I am Yilun Kuang, a second-year PhD student in Data Science at [NYU CDS](https://cds.nyu.edu/) & [NYU CILVR Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) working with Prof. [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/). My research interests includes Large Language Models, Diffusion Models, Self-Supervised Learning, Multimodal Vision-Language Learning, Probabilistic Generative Models, NeuroAI & AI for Science, ML Systems.

Prior to starting PhD, I graduated magna cum laude with high honors from NYU with a BA in Mathematics. I was fortunate to work with [SueYeon Chung](https://sites.google.com/site/sueyeonchung/) and [Eero Simoncelli](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/) on manifold geometry/efficient coding inspired self-supervised learning at the [Center for Computational Neuroscience of Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/yilun-kuang/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
